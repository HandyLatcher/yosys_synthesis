## 📘 About the Workshop

This workshop is designed for students, enthusiasts, and engineers interested in:

* Writing and simulating Verilog RTL
* Functional verification and waveform analysis using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**
* Performing **logic synthesis with Yosys** and the **Sky130 open-source PDK**
* Exploring digital design concepts including:

  * Testbenches and verification flow
  * Timing libraries and standard cell models
  * Verilog coding techniques for flip-flops
  * Synthesis-driven design and optimization

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

The following background and setup are recommended:

* Basic knowledge of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.)
* Familiarity with Linux shell commands
* A Linux machine (or WSL for Windows/macOS users)
* Installed tools: `git`, `iverilog`, `gtkwave`, `yosys`, and a text/code editor

---

## 🗂️ Workshop Roadmap

The workshop is divided into multiple days, each with a dedicated folder and README:

* **Day 1** → RTL design introduction & synthesis basics
* **Day 2** → Timing libraries, synthesis flow, and flip-flop coding techniques
* **Day 3** → Combinational and sequential logic optimization
* **Day 4** → Gate-level simulation (GLS), blocking vs. non-blocking, synthesis-simulation mismatch
* **Day 5** → Optimization strategies in synthesis

Each day includes:
✔️ Concept explanations  
✔️ Step-by-step lab exercises with Verilog code  
✔️ Screenshots and waveform analysis  
✔️ Practical design best practices
