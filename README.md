# **Day 1: Fundamentals of RTL Design and Synthesis**üñ•Ô∏è

The first day of the RTL design workshop introduces the essential concepts of digital circuit design at the register-transfer level (RTL). This session focuses on writing hardware descriptions using **Verilog**, verifying functionality with the open-source simulator **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, and performing basic **logic synthesis** with **Yosys**.

The workshop emphasizes understanding the complete RTL workflow, from coding and simulation to gate-level synthesis, through structured exercises and explanations.

---

## **1. Simulation, Design, and Testbench Concepts**

**Simulator:**
A simulator is a software tool that evaluates the behavior of digital circuits. It applies input patterns to the design and produces output responses, enabling verification before hardware implementation.

**Design:**
The design represents the hardware functionality described in Verilog code. It captures the intended logic behavior of a digital module.

**Testbench:**
A testbench is an environment used to validate the design. It generates input stimuli, monitors outputs, and ensures that the circuit functions correctly under various scenarios.

## **2. Using Icarus Verilog for Simulation**

**Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** is an open-source Verilog compiler and simulator. The typical simulation workflow involves:

1. Compiling the Verilog design along with its testbench.
2. Running the compiled simulation executable.
3. Generating a waveform file (.vcd) to visualize signals in **GTKWave**.

## **Week 1 Lab Setup: RTL Workshop (Root Mode)**

### **Step 1: Switch to Root Mode**

Start a root shell to perform administrative tasks:

```bash
sudo -i
```
Note- Root mode is not strictly necessary for cloning or creating folders in your home directory.

> The shell prompt changes to `root@hostname:#`. All commands are now executed with root privileges.

---

### **Step 2: Install Required Tools**

Install **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**:

```bash
apt update
apt install iverilog
apt install gtkwave
```

> These tools are required for Verilog simulation and waveform visualization.

---

### **Step 3: Navigate to a Workspace in Home Directory**

Even in root mode, you can work in your user‚Äôs home directory:

```bash
cd /home/<username>
```

> Replace `<username>` with your Ubuntu username (run `whoami` if unsure).

Create a dedicated folder for lab files:

```bash
mkdir VLSI
cd VLSI
```

---

### **Step 4: Clone the Workshop Repository**

Clone the repository into the `VLSI` folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```

---

### **Step 5: Access the Verilog Files**

Navigate into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```

List all files to see available lab exercises:

```bash
ls
```

> This directory contains all Verilog source files and corresponding testbenches needed for simulations.

---

## **Using GTKWave for Simulation and Waveform Analysis**

This section demonstrates the process of compiling a Verilog design, running the simulation, and visualizing signal waveforms using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**.

---

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Verilog Files Directory**

```bash
cd /home/<username>/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```

> Replace `<username>` with your Ubuntu username. This directory contains the Verilog source files and testbenches for the lab exercises.

---

### **Step 2: Compile the Design and Testbench**

```bash
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

> This command compiles the multiplexer module (`good_mux.v`) along with its testbench (`tb_good_mux.v`).

---

### **Step 3: Verify Compilation Output**

```bash
ls
```

* After compilation, a file named `a.out` will appear in the directory.
* This is the executable produced by Icarus Verilog.

---

### **Step 4: Run the Simulation**

```bash
./a.out
```

> Running this executable performs the simulation and generates a waveform file (`tb_good_mux.vcd`).

---

### **Step 5: Open GTKWave to Visualize Signals**

```bash
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

* GTKWave will launch and display the waveform corresponding to the simulation.
* Users can analyze the behavior of the 2-to-1 multiplexer by observing signal transitions for different input combinations.

## **Code Analysis for 2-to-1 Multiplexer**

This section describes the Verilog implementation of the **2-to-1 multiplexer** and its corresponding **testbench** used for simulation.

---

### **Testbench Code (`tb_good_mux.v`)**

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module tb_good_mux;

  // Inputs
  reg i0, i1, sel;

  // Outputs
  wire y;

  // Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
  good_mux uut (
    .sel(sel),
    .i0(i0),
    .i1(i1),
    .y(y)
  );

  initial begin
    $dumpfile("tb_good_mux.vcd");   // Create waveform file
    $dumpvars(0, tb_good_mux);      // Dump all variables
    // Initialize inputs
    sel = 0;
    i0 = 0;
    i1 = 0;
    #300 $finish;                   // End simulation after 300 ns
  end

  // Input stimulus
  always #75 sel = ~sel;
  always #10 i0 = ~i0;
  always #55 i1 = ~i1;

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* Initializes inputs and toggles them at different intervals to test all possible input combinations.
* Generates a `.vcd` file for waveform visualization in GTKWave.

---

### **Multiplexer Module (`good_mux.v`)**

```verilog
module good_mux (
    input i0, 
    input i1, 
    input sel, 
    output reg y
);

always @(*) begin
    if (sel)
        y <= i1;
    else
        y <= i0;
end

endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

* Implements a **2-to-1 multiplexer**.
* Output `y` follows `i1` when `sel = 1` and `i0` when `sel = 0`.
* Uses a combinational `always @(*)` block to ensure the output updates immediately when inputs change.

### **Getting Started with Yosys and Gate Libraries**

#### **What is Yosys?**

Yosys is an open-source digital synthesis tool widely used for turning Verilog designs into gate-level representations. Essentially, it transforms your high-level HDL description into a blueprint of actual logic gates, ready for hardware implementation.

---

#### **Key Capabilities of Yosys**

* **Synthesis:** Converts Verilog code into a network of logic gates.
* **Optimization:** Refines the design for faster operation, smaller area, or lower power.
* **Technology Mapping:** Matches logical gates to real hardware cells from standard libraries.
* **Verification:** Confirms that the synthesized circuit behaves as intended.
* **Extensibility:** Allows custom scripts and flows for specialized design needs.

---

#### **Why Gate Libraries Have Multiple Variants**

Standard cell libraries (often `.lib` files) provide multiple versions of the same logic gate to suit different design goals. For example, there can be several types of an AND gate, each optimized for:

* **Speed:** High-performance gates for timing-critical paths.
* **Power Consumption:** Low-power gates to save energy.
* **Area:** Compact gates to reduce chip size.
* **Drive Strength:** Stronger gates to drive large fan-outs.
* **Signal Quality:** Gates designed for noise-sensitive or high-speed circuits.

During synthesis, Yosys selects the most suitable gate ‚Äúflavor‚Äù based on your design‚Äôs priorities, balancing speed, power, area, and reliability.

## **Synthesis Lab: 2-Input MUX with Yosys**

Learn how to synthesize a simple 2-input multiplexer (**good\_mux**) using Yosys and map it to a standard cell library.

---

### **Step 1: Launch Yosys**

Open a terminal and start Yosys:

```bash
yosys
```

---

### **Step 2: Load the Standard Cell Library**

Yosys needs a `.lib` file to map your logic to actual gates. Use the following command:

```yosys
read_liberty -lib /path/to/your/library_file.lib
```

**Notes:**

* Replace `/path/to/your/library_file.lib` with the location of your standard cell library (e.g., SkyWater 130nm or any other library).
* This file contains all the gates Yosys can use for mapping.

---

### **Step 3: Read Your Verilog Design**

Load your 2-input MUX Verilog code:

```yosys
read_verilog /path/to/your/verilog_files/good_mux.v
```

**Notes:**

* Replace `/path/to/your/verilog_files/` with the folder containing your Verilog module.
* Ensure the filename matches your module definition, e.g., `good_mux.v`.

---

### **Step 4: Synthesize the Design**

Convert the high-level Verilog into a gate-level netlist:

```yosys
synth -top good_mux
```

* The `-top` flag tells Yosys which module is the top-level design.
* Yosys performs **logic optimization** and prepares the design for mapping.

---

### **Step 5: Technology Mapping**

Map the synthesized logic to real library cells using ABC:

```yosys
abc -liberty /path/to/your/library_file.lib
```

* Yosys replaces generic logic with **real gates** from the library.
* Optimization is applied based on timing, area, and power specifications in the library.

---

### **Step 6: Visualize the Gate-Level Netlist**

Inspect the synthesized netlist graphically:

```yosys
show
```

* This generates a **circuit diagram** showing how the inputs, outputs, and internal gates are connected.
* Useful for verifying your FSM or MUX logic visually.

</p>

---

### **Step 7: Export the Synthesized Netlist (Optional)**

Write the final gate-level netlist to a Verilog file:

```yosys
write_verilog -noattr -norename good_mux_netlist.v
```

**Options:**

* `-noattr` ‚Üí Removes synthesis attributes for a clean netlist.
* `-norename` ‚Üí Preserves your original signal names instead of using internal numbers.
