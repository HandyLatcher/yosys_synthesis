# Day 3: Combinational and Sequential Optimization âš¡

Day 3 focuses on optimization techniques for combinational and sequential circuits, covering:

- **Combinational Optimization**  
  Methods to reduce delay, logic depth, and area while improving speed.

- **Sequential Optimization**  
  Techniques to efficiently manage flip-flops, registers, and pipeline stages for better timing and resource usage.

- **Performance Enhancement**  
  Applying these strategies to achieve faster and more efficient RTL designs.

The session equips you with practical strategies to optimize circuits for speed, area, and overall performance.
