(1) **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)**
Covers how synthesized gate-level netlists behave and the methods to simulate them accurately.

(2) **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog**
Explains the differences between `=` (blocking) and `<=` (non-blocking) assignments, including timing effects and correct usage in sequential and combinational logic.

(3) **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch**
Discusses common causes of mismatches between RTL simulation and post-synthesis behavior, along with strategies to reduce or avoid such discrepancies.

The session combines **theoretical explanations** with **hands-on lab exercises** to reinforce the concepts.

## 1. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) ‚ö°

**Overview:**  
Gate-Level Simulation is a step in the VLSI verification flow where the **netlist produced by synthesis** is simulated. The purpose is to ensure the circuit behaves correctly once RTL is transformed into actual logic gates.  

**Objectives:**  
- Confirm that the circuit **produces correct outputs**.  
- Examine the effects of **signal propagation delays**.  
- Estimate **post-synthesis power consumption**.  
- Verify **test-related features**, such as scan chains for DFT.  

**Importance:**  
- **Verify Synthesis Results:** Checks that tools accurately convert RTL to gate-level representation.  
- **Timing Checks:** Using annotated delays (like SDF), it helps spot setup/hold timing issues.  
- **Test Verification:** Ensures scan chains and other test circuits function after synthesis.  

**When to Run GLS:**  
- After the RTL has been **synthesized into a netlist**.  
- Before **layout and physical design** to catch potential issues early.  

**Simulation Types:**  
- **Logic-Only GLS:** Ignores or uses minimal delays; focuses purely on functional correctness.  
- **Timing-Aware GLS:** Incorporates realistic timing data to verify critical path behavior.

## 2. Post-Synthesis vs. RTL Mismatches ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What It Is:**  
Sometimes the **behavior seen in RTL simulation** differs from what occurs in **gate-level simulation or hardware**, leading to mismatches.  

**Typical Causes:**  
- **Unsupported RTL Constructs:** Use of delays, `initial` blocks, or other non-synthesizable elements.  
- **Incomplete Logic Coding:** Missing `else` statements, incomplete sensitivity lists, or ambiguous constructs.  
- **Tool Differences:** RTL may be interpreted slightly differently by simulation and synthesis tools.  

**Best Practices:**  
- Stick to **synthesizable and unambiguous code**.  
- Always define **all logic paths clearly**.  
- Follow **consistent coding conventions** to reduce post-synthesis surprises.

## Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog ‚ö°

Verilog provides two ways to assign values within procedural blocks, each with different timing and use cases.

---

## 1. Blocking Assignments (`=`)

- **Syntax:** `=`  
- **Execution Behavior:** Happens **immediately in sequence**; the next statement waits for the current one to finish.  
- **Typical Usage:** Best suited for **combinational logic**, such as in `always @(*)` blocks.  
- **Example:**
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    y = a & b; // Evaluates immediately
end
````

---

## 2. Non-Blocking Assignments (`<=`)

* **Syntax:** `<=`
* **Execution Behavior:** Updates are **scheduled and applied concurrently** at the end of the time step.
* **Typical Usage:** Designed for **sequential logic**, like in `always @(posedge clk)` blocks.
* **Example:**

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= d; // Scheduled for end-of-step update
end
```

---

**Key Point:**

* Use **blocking** for combinational logic to maintain predictable execution order.
* Use **non-blocking** for flip-flop or register behavior to avoid race conditions and maintain proper sequential timing.

## **Labs**

# Lab 1: 2-to-1 Multiplexer Using Ternary Operator üîπ

**Objective:**  
Implement a simple 2:1 multiplexer using a ternary operator in Verilog.

**Verilog Code:**
```verilog
module ternary_operator_mux (
    input i0,
    input i1,
    input sel,
    output y
);
    assign y = sel ? i1 : i0; // Select i1 if sel=1, else i0
endmodule
````

**Functionality:**

* When `sel = 1`, the output `y` takes the value of `i1`.
* When `sel = 0`, the output `y` takes the value of `i0`.
* Acts as a **2:1 multiplexer** with a compact ternary assignment.

## Lab 2: Synthesizing the 2:1 MUX Using Yosys ‚ö°

**Objective:**  
Generate a **gate-level netlist** for the 2:1 multiplexer from Lab 1 using the Yosys synthesis flow.

**Yosys Synthesis Steps:**

```tcl
# 1. Load the standard cell library (optional)
read_liberty -lib <your_lib>.lib

# 2. Read the RTL Verilog file
read_verilog ternary_operator_mux.v

# 3. Run synthesis for the top module
synth -top ternary_operator_mux

# 4. Map the logic to the standard cell library (optional)
abc -liberty <your_lib>.lib

# 5. Export the synthesized gate-level netlist
write_verilog -noattr ternary_operator_mux_net.v
````

**Notes:**

* Replace `<your_lib>.lib` with the actual path to your standard cell library.
* `ternary_operator_mux.v` is the RTL design file from Lab 1.
* The generated file `ternary_operator_mux_net.v` contains the **gate-level netlist** of the multiplexer, ready for GLS or further verification.

## Lab 3: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) of the MUX ‚öôÔ∏è

**Objective:**  
Run a **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** on the synthesized 2:1 multiplexer to verify its functionality after synthesis.

**GLS Command:**

```bash
iverilog /path/to/primitives.v /path/to/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v ternary_operator_mux.v testbench.v

````

**Notes:**

* `/path/to/primitives.v` ‚Üí path to the technology library primitives file.
* `/path/to/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v` ‚Üí correct standard cell library model file.
* `ternary_operator_mux.v` ‚Üí synthesized gate-level netlist from Lab 2.
* `testbench.v` ‚Üí provides input stimulus for simulation.

‚úÖ This ensures the **synthesized netlist behaves the same as the RTL design**, confirming synthesis correctness.

## Lab 4: Bad MUX Example ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Objective:**  
Highlight common mistakes when coding a multiplexer in Verilog and demonstrate the corrected approach.

---

### üö´ Faulty Verilog Code:
```verilog
module bad_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
  always @ (sel) begin
    if (sel)
      y <= i1;
    else 
      y <= i0;
  end
endmodule
````

**Problems:**

1. **Incomplete sensitivity list** ‚Üí only `sel` is included, but `i0` and `i1` are missing.
2. **Incorrect assignment type** ‚Üí non-blocking (`<=`) is used inside combinational logic; blocking (`=`) should be used instead.

---

### ‚úÖ Corrected Verilog Code:

```verilog
always @ (*) begin
  if (sel)
    y = i1;
  else
    y = i0;
end
```

**Fixes:**

* `@(*)` ensures all inputs (`i0`, `i1`, `sel`) are considered.
* Uses **blocking assignment (`=`)**, which is the right choice for combinational logic.

## Lab 5: Gate-Level Simulation of bad_mux ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Objective:**  
Run **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** on the `bad_mux` module.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
- Simulation may produce **mismatches or warnings** due to the issues in the design (incomplete sensitivity list, non-blocking assignment in combinational logic).  
- Compare with RTL simulation to observe differences in behavior.

<p align="center">

</p>

## Lab 6: Blocking Assignment Caveat ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate a common pitfall when using **blocking assignments (`=`)** in combinational logic.

---

## üö´ Problematic Verilog Code:
```verilog
module blocking_caveat (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output reg d
);
    reg x;
    always @ (*) begin
        d = x & c;
        x = a | b;
    end
endmodule
````

**Issue:**

* `d` uses the **previous value of `x`** because assignments are executed sequentially in blocking style.
* This leads to incorrect combinational behavior.

---

## ‚úÖ Corrected Verilog Code:

```verilog
always @ (*) begin
    x = a | b;  // Compute intermediate value first
    d = x & c;  // Use updated value
end
```

**Best Practice:**

* When using blocking assignments, **always assign intermediate variables before using them** to avoid race-like issues.

## Lab 7: Synthesis of the Blocking Caveat Module ‚ö°

**Objective:**  
Synthesize the **corrected `blocking_caveat` module** to generate a gate-level netlist and observe its behavior.

**Yosys Synthesis Steps:**

```tcl
# 1. (Optional) Load the standard cell library
read_liberty -lib <your_lib>.lib

# 2. Read the corrected RTL
read_verilog blocking_caveat.v

# 3. Run synthesis for the top module
synth -top blocking_caveat

# 4. Map to the standard cell library (optional)
abc -liberty <your_lib>.lib

# 5. Write the gate-level netlist
write_verilog -noattr blocking_caveat.v
````

**Notes:**

* `<your_lib>.lib` ‚Üí path to your standard cell library.
* `blocking_caveat.v` ‚Üí corrected RTL file.
* The output netlist represents the **gate-level synthesized design**, ready for GLS or further verification.
