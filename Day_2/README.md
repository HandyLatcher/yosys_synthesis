# Day 2: Timing, Synthesis & Flip-Flop Optimization ‚è±Ô∏è

Day 2 of the RTL Workshop covers three key topics:

- **Timing Libraries**  
  Overview of `.lib` files in open-source PDKs (e.g., `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`), including delays, setup/hold times, and drive strengths for accurate timing analysis.

- **Synthesis Approaches**  
  Comparison of **hierarchical** vs **flat** synthesis, highlighting modular management versus global optimization trade-offs.

- **Efficient Flip-Flop Coding**  
  Best practices for RTL flip-flop design to optimize area, power, and timing while avoiding hazards.

The session provides a clear understanding of timing library usage, synthesis methodology selection, and optimized flip-flop coding.

# Timing Libraries: SKY130 PDK Overview ‚öôÔ∏è

**SKY130 PDK**  
The SKY130 Process Design Kit is an open-source PDK based on SkyWater Technology's 130nm CMOS process. It provides essential models and libraries for IC design, including timing, power, and process variation data.  

**Decoding `tt_025C_1v80`**  
- `tt`: Typical process corner  
- `025C`: Temperature of 25¬∞C  
- `1v80`: Core voltage of 1.8V  

This naming convention specifies the process, voltage, and temperature conditions represented in the timing library.

# Opening and Exploring the `.lib` File üìÑ

To open the `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib` file:

1. **Install a text editor** (if not already installed):
```
sudo apt install gedit
```
Open the file:
```
gedit sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```

# Hierarchical vs. Flattened Synthesis ‚öôÔ∏è

## Hierarchical Synthesis

**Definition:**  
Retains the module hierarchy as defined in RTL, synthesizing modules separately.

**How it Works:**  
Tools like Yosys process each module independently, using commands such as `hierarchy` to analyze and set up the design structure.

**Advantages:**  
- Faster synthesis time for large designs.  
- Improved debugging and analysis due to maintained module boundaries.  
- Modular approach, aiding integration with other tools.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Cross-module optimizations are limited.  
- Reporting may require additional configuration.  

**An example of Hierarchical Synthesis:**

**Netlist:**

## Flattened Synthesis ‚ö°

**Definition:**  
Merges all modules into a single flat netlist, eliminating hierarchy.

**How it Works:**  
The `flatten` command in Yosys collapses the hierarchy, allowing whole-design optimizations.

**Advantages:**  
- Enables aggressive, cross-module optimizations.  
- Results in a unified netlist, sometimes simplifying downstream processes.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Longer runtime for large designs.  
- Loss of hierarchy complicates debugging and reporting.  
- Can increase memory usage and netlist complexity.

**An example of Flattened Synthesis:**

**Sub ModuleüìÇ**

(1)It is used when we have multiple instances of same module

(2)It is also used for Divide and Conquer technique

# Flip-Flop Coding Styles ‚ö°

Flip-flops are fundamental sequential elements in digital design, used to store binary data. Below are efficient coding styles for different reset/set behaviors.

---

## Asynchronous Reset D Flip-Flop üõë

```verilog
module dff_asyncres (
    input clk,
    input async_reset,
    input d,
    output reg q
);
  always @ (posedge clk, posedge async_reset)
    if (async_reset)
      q <= 1'b0;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
````

* **Asynchronous reset:** Overrides clock, setting `q` to 0 immediately.
* **Edge-triggered:** Captures `d` on rising clock edge if reset is low.

---

## Asynchronous Set D Flip-Flop ‚ö°

```verilog
module dff_async_set (
    input clk,
    input async_set,
    input d,
    output reg q
);
  always @ (posedge clk, posedge async_set)
    if (async_set)
      q <= 1'b1;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```

* **Asynchronous set:** Overrides clock, setting `q` to 1 immediately.

---

## Synchronous Reset D Flip-Flop ‚è±Ô∏è

```verilog
module dff_syncres (
    input clk,
    input async_reset,
    input sync_reset,
    input d,
    output reg q
);
  always @ (posedge clk)
    if (sync_reset)
      q <= 1'b0;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```

**Synchronous reset:** Takes effect only on the clock edge.
