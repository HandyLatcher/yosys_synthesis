# **RTL Design Week1 Overview**ðŸš€

This week covers the fundamentals of register-transfer level (RTL) design, including Verilog coding, simulation using Icarus Verilog, and basic logic synthesis with Yosys. The sessions guide through the complete RTL workflow, from writing and testing designs to synthesizing gate-level circuits.

# Day 2: Timing, Synthesis & Flip-Flop Optimization

Day 2 of the RTL Workshop focuses on three key topics:

- **Timing Libraries**  
  Introduction to `.lib` files in open-source PDKs, e.g., `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`, covering delays, setup/hold times, and drive strengths for accurate timing analysis.

- **Synthesis Approaches**  
  Comparison of **hierarchical** vs **flat** synthesis, highlighting modular management versus global optimization trade-offs.

- **Efficient Flip-Flop Coding**  
  Best practices for RTL flip-flop design to optimize area, power, and timing while avoiding hazards.

The session provides a clear understanding of timing data usage, synthesis methodology selection, and optimized flip-flop coding.
